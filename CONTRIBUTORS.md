### And many more...

Throughout it's life, MailCleaner was able to florish due to the efforts of many others who may not have contributed code or translations. This includes:

* thousands of contributors to the dozens of projects that MailCleaner was built upon, from the Linux kernel, to the Debian maintainers and contributors, to Apache's SpamAssassin, the Exim MTA, MailScanner, and many others.
* dozens of users who opened issues through GitHub, more who reported issues via the MailCleaner support system and hundreds more who discussed MailCleaner in the public forum.
* the hundreds of Enterprise Edition customers who made it possible to financially support one or more developers at any given time.
* the many thousands (millions?) of users who use the products every day, shared recommendations with friends, colleagues and strangers, and trusted us with their email.

If you've made contributions at any time to MailCleaner or SpamTagger and you don't see your name listed, feel free to open a pull request to have it added.
