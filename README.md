# Welcome to SpamTagger Plus

SpamTagger Plus is a fork of the [MailCleaner](https://github.com/MailCleaner) anti spam gateway.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Development of a new release of SpamTagger Plus is ongoing and this repository is no longer compatible with existing MailCleaner systems which are based on Debian Jessie.

There are currently no public downloads available for the release since build infrastructure is not complete and the development VM is in a non-working state and is changing too quickly to reasonably provide regular updates.

Please stay tuned for more information and feel free to discuss development in the relevant GitHub tabs.
